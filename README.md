**Currently ShpeeBot 9 is in a very alpha stage.**  
Lots of things don't work and I have been getting less time to work on them.  
  
I will be posting development updates at <https://medium.com/shpeebot>  
See my notes for the full development status: <https://usejournal.com/app/space/journal:space:project/4820419a-9d1c-4dee-a153-224bffc8d5ed>  

***Issue reports and pull requests will be highly appreciated.***

This README will be updated as I update ShpeeBot.
