# ShpeeBot
The multi-purpose Discord bot.

---

**Currently ShpeeBot 9 is in a very alpha stage.**  
Lots of things don't work and I have been getting less time to work on them.  
  
I will be posting development updates at <https://medium.com/shpeebot>  
See my notes for the full development status: <https://doc.clickup.com/p/h/6kdt2-9/10fbe3e33b93f51/6kdt2-9>  

***Issue reports and pull requests will be highly appreciated.***

This README will be updated as I update ShpeeBot.
